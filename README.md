# Ferinth

Ferinth provides Rust API bindings for the [Modrinth API](https://docs.modrinth.com)

## Missing Features

- Search functionality
- Requests that require large body data
- Better organisation of API calls

## Versioning

The major version of this crate's version directly corresponds to the Modrinth API version it uses.
If you want to use the Modrinth API version 2, which is the latest one currently, specify this crate's major version as `2`.

Due to this feature, there will be breaking changes in minor version bumps too!
